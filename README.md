# Sipsuru Web

An Electron application for wrap [Sipsuru Website](https://www.sipsuru.com) & launch Dragon-Patched Sipsuru Media Player

So, simply this's the launcher app for Dragon Patched Sipsuru Media Player. Which doesn't allow users to open courses from original website itself. We've restricted to use our launcher only by changing "yombok" protocol to "dragon" with this app. 
We've restricted this because we believe that we have to be-with our own brand name, and this'll allow users to automatic login in future. Meaning no session login expires, then re login in future. (Not yet implemented)

  - We've **removed yombok token's user id** and replaced *yombok* protocol with *dragon*, to be used with Sipsuru Media Player.
